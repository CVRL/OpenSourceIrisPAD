# OpenSourceIrisPAD


This repo contains the open-source (planned) implementation of iris PAD based on BSIF and a fusion of multiple classifiers, and is based on Jay Doyle's paper: "Robust Detection of Textured Contact Lenses in Iris Recognition Using BSIF", IEEE Access, 2015 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7264974/).
